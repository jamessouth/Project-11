React Flickr Gallery

This project calls the Flickr API which uses free but private API keys, so I have not created a public-facing live site. If you want to try it out on your local computer, do the following:


click the clone or download button above, then click download ZIP

expand the files into a directory of your choice

navigate to said directory in terminal/bash

type
